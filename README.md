# Hello, I am Mateus de Campos Cavalcanti, also known as mateusdcc

I am a developer who is always eager to learn new things. I am currently learning Rust as a programming language and operating systems. I have extensive knowledge of Javascript, Python, CSS, SASS, Nix, Lua, and a lot more. 

I am a Linux lover, and have already used distributions such as Exherbo, Arch, Artix, NixOs, Gentoo, and Fedora. I also have intermediate knowledge and experience in full stack web development, using Javascript (NodeJS, NextJS, and ReactJS) and CSS (SASS and TailwindCSS).

In addition to my passion for software development, I am also taking an electronics technician course. I am always open for book suggestions, particularly those related to math or operating systems. If you want to reach me, you can message me at IRC: irc://libera.chat:pitagoras

I recently deleted a lot of my repositories that I thought weren't good enough for my Github profile. But don't worry, I will be putting a lot more projects on it soon!

I am a wholesome person, and I always try to do my best. I appreciate your visit to my Github profile and I hope you enjoy what you see here.
